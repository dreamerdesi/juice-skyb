## About
4 hours to break apart a PSD focused on a Juice business and use HTML/CSS/SCSS/JS to build it.

## Where you can see it
http://desarae-gabrielle.com/juice

## What I did
- I used css + jquery to mock up the PSD in code. All css styles can be found in css/styles.css. 
- Javascript can be found in js/all.js. jQuery was my JS of choice.

## What I finished
- desktop version, mobile version (mostly).

## what's left to do
- Mobile / tablet is about 90% done. Ideally, I would like to finish the hamburger menu for mobile
 and go over all media queries to make sure and test that everything is responsive.
